/*
  # Temporarily disable RLS for promotions table

  This migration temporarily disables Row Level Security for the promotions table
  to allow admin users to create promotions while we debug the RLS policy issues.
  
  1. Disable RLS on promotions table
  2. Remove existing policies that are causing conflicts
  
  Note: This is a temporary fix to unblock promotion creation.
  RLS should be re-enabled with proper policies once the issue is resolved.
